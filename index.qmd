## Overview

Welcome to the Statistics Foundations project! This repository contains resources, code, and documentation for understanding fundamental concepts in statistics.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to foundational statistical concepts through interactive visualizations and practical examples. It is designed for students, educators, and professionals who want to deepen their understanding of statistics.

## Example app

This is a simple Shinylive application embedded in a Quarto doc.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
#| layout: vertical

from shiny import *

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 40),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"The value of n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"

app = App(app_ui, server)

```
